### **Blog Post: Embracing Spring Contracts for Web Development**

Web development has evolved significantly, and with it, the need for robust, maintainable, and efficient services has grown. When building modern web applications, particularly microservices, one critical aspect is ensuring that different services can communicate effectively. This is where Spring Contracts, part of the Spring Cloud Contract framework, come into play. Today, we'll dive into the benefits of using Spring Contracts in web development, using a practical example from a GitHub repository to illustrate its power.

#### **What is Spring Cloud Contract?**

Spring Cloud Contract is a framework that enables Consumer-Driven Contract (CDC) development of microservices. It ensures that services (both providers and consumers) can communicate without integration issues by defining a contract between them. This contract is a formal agreement specifying how a service expects to interact with another, effectively preventing the classic "it works on my machine" problem.

The repository we're discussing, [IBA Group's app-modernization-examples](https://github.com/ibagroup-eu/app-modernization-examples/tree/feature-spring-contract-first), provides a practical implementation of contract-first development using Spring Cloud Contract. Let’s explore how this approach can benefit your projects.

### **Why Use Spring Contracts in Your Web Development?**

1. **Improved Collaboration Between Teams**

   With Spring Contracts, teams can develop services independently, knowing that their services will work together when integrated. This is particularly beneficial in a microservices architecture where different teams are responsible for different services. By using contracts to define the expectations between services, developers can avoid misunderstandings and bugs that arise from mismatched expectations.

2. **Early Bug Detection and Faster Feedback Loop**

   Writing contracts upfront and using them for testing allows teams to detect and fix integration issues early in the development cycle. Spring Cloud Contract automatically generates tests from the contracts, ensuring that both consumers and providers adhere to the defined expectations. This leads to a faster feedback loop and reduces the chances of bugs creeping into production.

   In the example repository, a contract is defined to specify the interactions between services. When changes are made to a service, automated tests ensure that these changes do not break the contract, providing immediate feedback to developers.

3. **Reduced Integration Testing Overhead**

   Integration testing can be cumbersome and time-consuming, especially when multiple services are involved. Spring Contracts simplify this process by automatically generating mocks and stubs based on the contracts. These mocks can be used to simulate the behavior of the service provider, allowing the consumer to be tested in isolation without needing the provider to be deployed.

   The repository demonstrates this with a contract-first approach, where contracts are defined first, and both consumer and provider tests are generated based on these contracts, effectively reducing the integration testing overhead.

4. **Easier Refactoring and Maintenance**

   Spring Contracts make it easier to refactor and maintain services. Since the contract defines a clear boundary between services, any changes made within the boundary (such as internal refactoring) do not affect other services. This encapsulation of service changes helps maintain a clean architecture and promotes best practices in web development.

   In the example repository, services can be refactored independently as long as they adhere to the contracts. This flexibility allows teams to improve and optimize their services without breaking the overall system.

5. **Enhanced Documentation and Understanding**

   Contracts serve as living documentation for how services interact with each other. They provide a clear and unambiguous description of the expected inputs and outputs, which is especially useful when onboarding new developers or integrating third-party services.

   The repository shows how contracts are used to define endpoints, request parameters, and expected responses. This clarity helps developers quickly understand how to interact with a service, reducing onboarding time and improving overall productivity.

6. **Support for Multiple Languages and Tools**

   Spring Cloud Contract supports various languages and tools, making it highly versatile. Whether you're working with Java, Kotlin, Groovy, or even other platforms like Node.js or Python, you can use Spring Cloud Contract to define and enforce contracts across different services.

   The example repository primarily uses Java, but the concepts and benefits of using Spring Contracts are applicable across other languages and platforms supported by the framework, making it a versatile choice for many development environments.

### **How to Start Using Spring Contracts with IBA Group's Repository**

To help you get started with Spring Contracts, we’ll guide you through setting up the project from the [IBA Group's app-modernization-examples repository](https://github.com/ibagroup-eu/app-modernization-examples/tree/feature-spring-contract-first). We'll walk through the steps needed to clone the repository, run the application, and embed Spring Contracts into your development flow.

#### **Step 1: Cloning the Repository**

First, clone the repository to your local machine. Make sure you are on the correct branch (`feature-spring-contract-first`) which contains the example code for Spring Contracts.

```bash
git clone -b feature-spring-contract-first https://github.com/ibagroup-eu/app-modernization-examples.git
cd app-modernization-examples
```

#### **Step 2: Understanding the Project Structure**

After cloning the repository, familiarize yourself with its structure:

- **`/contracts/`**: Contains contract definitions written in Groovy or YAML. These contracts define how services communicate, including expected requests and responses.
- **`/src/main/java`**: The main source code for the example application, demonstrating both consumer and provider services.
- **`/src/test/java`**: Contains auto-generated tests based on the contracts, ensuring compliance with the contract definitions.

#### **Step 3: Defining Your First Contract**

1. **Create a Contract File**: In the `/contracts` directory, create a contract file (e.g., `Contract.groovy`):

   ```groovy
   package contracts

   org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
       request {
           method 'GET'
           url '/api/user'
           headers {
               header('Content-Type', 'application/json')
           }
       }
       response {
           status 200
           body([
               id: $(regex('[0-9]+')),
               name: $(regex('[A-Za-z ]+'))
           ])
           headers {
               header('Content-Type', 'application/json')
           }
       }
   }
   ```

   This example contract specifies that when a GET request is made to `/api/user`, the server should return a 200 status code with a JSON body containing `id` and `name`.

2. **Configure the Contract Plugin**: Open the `pom.xml` file (if you're using Maven) or `build.gradle` (for Gradle) and ensure that the Spring Cloud Contract plugin is configured.

   For **Maven**:

   ```xml
   <build>
       <plugins>
           <plugin>
               <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
               <artifactId>spring-cloud-contract-maven-plugin</artifactId>
               <version>3.1.3</version>
               <executions>
                   <execution>
                       <goals>
                           <goal>convert</goal>
                           <goal>generateTests</goal>
                       </goals>
                   </execution>
               </executions>
           </plugin>
       </plugins>
   </build>
   ```

   For **Gradle**:

   ```groovy
   plugins {
       id "org.springframework.cloud.contract" version "3.1.3"
   }

   contracts {
       baseClassForTests = 'com.example.BaseClass'
   }
   ```

   This configuration tells Maven or Gradle to use the Spring Cloud Contract plugin to generate tests based on your contract definitions.

#### **Step 4: Generating and Running Tests**

Run the following command to generate tests from the contract files:

- **For Maven**:
   ```bash
   ./mvnw clean install
   ```

- **For Gradle**:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew clean build
   ```

The plugin will generate test classes in the `target/generated-test-sources` (for Maven) or `build/generated-test-sources` (for Gradle) directory. These tests verify that the service adheres to the defined contract.

Next, execute the tests:

```bash
./mvnw test    # for Maven
./gradlew test # for Gradle
```

If all tests pass, it means your service complies with the defined contracts. Otherwise, check the test output to identify any deviations from the contract.

#### **Step 5: Embedding Spring Contracts into Your Development Flow**

1. **Automate Contract Tests in CI/CD Pipeline**:
   Integrate the contract tests into your continuous integration (CI) pipeline to ensure that all service changes are validated against the contracts. Add a step in your CI configuration file (e.g., `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for GitHub Actions) to run the contract tests.

   **Example for GitHub Actions:**

   ```yaml
   name: CI Pipeline

   on: [push, pull_request]

   jobs:
     build:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v2
         - name: Set up JDK 11
           uses: actions/setup-java@v1
           with:
             java-version: '11'
         - name: Build and Test with Maven
           run: ./mvnw clean install
   ```

2. **Use Mocks and Stubs for Faster Development**:
   Spring Cloud Contract generates stubs that mimic the behavior of the provider service, allowing you to develop the consumer service independently. Configure your consumer application to use these stubs during local development or testing.

   For example, in your consumer application’s test configuration, point to the stub server:

   ```java
   @AutoConfigureStubRunner(ids = {"com.example:provider:+:stubs:8080"}, stubsMode = StubRunnerProperties.StubsMode.LOCAL)
   public class ConsumerContractTest {
       @Autowired
       private TestRestTemplate restTemplate;

       @Test
       public void shouldReturnUser() {
           ResponseEntity<User> response = restTemplate.getForEntity("/api/user", User.class);
           assertEquals(200, response.getStatusCodeValue());
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Monitor Contract Changes with Versioning**:
   As your application evolves, so will your contracts. Implement version control for your contract files to manage changes effectively. Tag contract changes in your versioning system (e.g., Git tags) and communicate these changes with your team to ensure all services remain compatible.

#### **Step 6: Leverage Contract-Driven Development for Future Enhancements**

Adopt a **Contract-First** approach where contracts are defined before the actual service implementation. This strategy aligns your team on the expected behavior of the services early on, fostering a more collaborative development environment.

- **Start with Contracts**: Create contracts based on API specifications or use cases.
- **Implement and Verify**: Develop your services to meet these contracts.
- **Test and Deploy**: Integrate contract tests into your CI/CD pipeline, and deploy services with confidence, knowing they meet their expected behaviors.

### **Conclusion**

By following these steps, you can integrate Spring Contracts seamlessly into your web development workflow. Using the example from the [IBA Group's repository](https://github.com/ibagroup-eu/app-modernization-examples/tree/feature-spring-contract-first), you can leverage the power of Consumer-Driven Contracts to build reliable and maintainable web applications. This approach enhances collaboration, reduces integration issues, and accelerates your development process.
